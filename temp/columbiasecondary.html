        <p><b>Above:</b> 2016-17 MSG Student President Mia Russo giving a speech at the Stepping Up Ceremony in June.</p>
        <p>Columbia Secondary School for Math, Science, and Engineering is a public 6-12 school in the Morningside Heights neighborhood of New York City. I attended this school for four years - three as a middle schooler and one as a high school freshman.</p>
        <p>During this time I was very involved with student government, serving as class rep twice and president for a year. In addition to serving on the council, I helped make posters for and photograph events. This is a gallery of some of the work I did for the Columbia Secondary School Student Government and other organizations and clubs there.</p>
