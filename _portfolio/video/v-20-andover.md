Phillips Academy is a prestigious private high school in Andover, MA. In winter 2017-18, I worked with the admissions office and fellow student Sophie Huang '20 to produce a set of five videos showcasing the math, science, art, and theater/dance departments, as well as one on student weekend life. These were sent out to all newly admitted students as a part of the 2018 #SayYesToAndover campaign.
