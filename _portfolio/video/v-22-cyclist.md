Andover Moviemakers is Phillips Academy's premier community and organization of filmmakers. The board application this year required a thirty-second short film. Taking the opportunity of being Andover Cycling's team photographer when I wasn't racing, I made a little short about cycling, featuring teammate Grace Hitchcock and other racers in the league.
