"First printed in 1857, *The Phillipian* is Phillips Academy’s weekly student newspaper. Entirely uncensored and student run, the paper is distributed every Friday from September to June." —[phillipian.net](http://phillipian.net)

*The Phillipian* has a long history in print form. In recent years its began to expand its efforts on the digital front, establishing digital and video sections and management positions. Since May 2018 I've been a part of the video section, leading production, producing a new set of branding and motion graphics, and pushing the quality of content produced to a new level.
