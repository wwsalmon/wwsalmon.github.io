In January 2018, I participated in Andover Moviemakers' Flash Films, an event where a film is written, shot, and edited in the course of 24 hours. The event began 8 PM on Friday night; with my friend Maxwell Bao, I had a script written by 5 AM, slept two hours, shot and edited the film the next day, and watched it on the big screen at 8 PM Saturday.
