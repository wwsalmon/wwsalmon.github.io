In March 2018, I worked with two other photographer/videographers to put together a same-day edit for a Greenlight for Girls event at Andover. The event started at 8 AM; our whole crew split up and shot until around noon, then I edited as the rest of the crew continued shooting. The above video was screened at the closing of the event at 2 PM.
