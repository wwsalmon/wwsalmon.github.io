From [fowachallenge.com](http://fowachallenge.com/):

> The Food Waste Challenge is a Phillips Academy student-led event that encourages the community to reduce food waste on campus while assisting malnourished communities.

In April 2018, I worked with fellow students Allison Zhu and Isabella Morona to make a kickoff video, to be played at All School Meeting to all students the Wednesday before the challenge. Due to a scheduling change, ASM was cancelled that week, and the video was instead sent out by email and posted on the FoWa Challenge website.
