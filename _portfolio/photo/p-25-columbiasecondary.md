Columbia Secondary School is a public 6â€“12 school in Harlem/Morningside Heights, New York City. This was the school that I attended from 7th through 9th grade. During this time, I pushed myself to be involved with the school community: I served as student rep for two years, student government president for one, editor of the student journal of philosophy, Contrariwise, for one, and more. During this time, I also took a whole lot of photos; I've chosen the best for this gallery.
