Learning programming has never been easier thanks to innumerable passionate developers who have and continue to pour their knowledge and time into online tutorail websites and forums. Everything is just a Google Search away. However, the quality of these resources is greatly variable, and oftentimes assume a certain level of understanding and include excess styling and other code. While helpful for developers who know what this means, it can be confusing to new learners or even those coming back to find a quick reference.

Simplest Form aims to contribute something unique to this vast knowledge base: code tutorials that, when it comes to code, are stripped-down and straightforward, yet through thorough explanation and step-by-step walkthroughs, are just as understandable and easy-to-follow.

Currently this project is still under development. I am working on setting up the website and designing our branding and identity. You can see development versions [on the organization GitHub](https://github.com/simplestform) and [the development/staging website](https://simplestform-dev.netlify.com/).
