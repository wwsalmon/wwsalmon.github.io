This is a project I just wrapped up this summer, and a full written case study is coming soon. In the meantime, you can find our final presentation and some images and videos below.

## Design + Prototyping Images

### Week 1: Ideation
Coming up with the ideas and basic design for our project.

{% include slider-gen.html data=page.slider-week-1 %}

### Week 2/3: Early Prototyping
We design our mount and grabber mechanism. We spend a lot of time and iterations figuring out the tolerances of the printer and changing our dimensions slightly to make the mechanism work.

### Week 4: Grabber Testing, Mount Early Prototyping
We design our mount and grabber mechanism. We spend a lot of time and iterations figuring out the tolerances of the printer and changing our dimensions slightly to make the mechanism work.

### Week 5: First Functional Prototype, Testing
After several iterations, the whole device put together finally works as we want it to. We start designing an acrylic assembly to make the whole device sturdier and more reliable.

### Week 6: Final Prototype (for now)
We laser cut and assemble our acrylic base; the device is now one piece, without relying on pieces of cardboard taped to the stand to function. It can now be moved around and sit on a grand piano. We also build a foot pedal.
