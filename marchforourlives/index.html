          <p>From <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/March_for_Our_Lives">Wikipedia</a>:</p>

          <blockquote>March for Our Lives was a student-led demonstration in support of tighter gun control that took place on March 24, 2018, in Washington, D.C., with over 800 sibling events throughout the United States and around the world.</blockquote>

          <p>On March 24, 100,000 people met at the South End of Boston and marched to the Common. These included students, activists, and others who were tired of the prevalence of gun violence in America. I was among them, and took the opportunity to snap a few pictures.</p>
