*my personal website/portfolio*

This repo hosts my personal website, a video/photo portfolio hosted at [wwsalmon.com](http://www.wwsalmon.com). The current live website was prototype version 0.4.5, aka videoportfolio2.

Under /archive, it also hosts a little documentation of previous versions of wwsalmon.com, including a detailed commentary and lightly modified prototypes from 0.3.3 to 0.4.4.
