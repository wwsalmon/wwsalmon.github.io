      <p><b>Form:</b> YouTube Video/Informational Video/Video Essay<br/>
      <b>Roles:</b> Writer, Host, Cinematographer, Editor</p>
      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>When I first wrote the case study for this project, I called it lots of things - "the culmination of what I wanted to gain from my run on YouTube", "the last full review video before other video projects or my work for 2 Train Robotics took over". Then, I got an email from Alien asking me to review the Sound Intone P6s.</p>
      <p>In retrospect, I would rather say that my XB950 review was more the start of a new period than the end of an old one; my YouTube channel still hosts the same genre of content that it always has - tech review videos, and I haven't stopped making those. However, the XB950s marked the point where the skills that I gained allowed me to pursue lots of other opportunities, like <a href='../2-train-chairmans'>2 Train Robotics</a> and my <a href='../fallen-short-film'>short film projects</a>.</p>
      <p>As I wrote previously: "It was...a milestone in many ways: it was the first video I fully edited and color graded in Premiere Pro, the first full review video I filmed with a proper DSLR camera (the Sony RX10 II), and I was able to experiment a lot with lighting, foley/sound effects, motion graphics, and color. All of this paid off when I got new, bigger opportunities to further use and develop my filmmaking skills."</p>
      <p>The rest of this case study holds the behind-the-scenes explanations as it was written before the start of <a href='../p6-review/index.html'>production on my P6 video</a>; since my XB950 video, I have improved in many ways, but much of it carries over to what I continue to do.</p>

      <h3>Timetable</h3>
      <p>Pre-production: 1-2 weeks<br/>Production: 1-2 weeks<br/>Post-production: ~1 week</p>
      <h3>The Making of</h3>
      <p>The video consisted of two sections: an introduction section, and an A-roll/B-roll hosted section.</p>
      <img src='screen-3.jpg'/>
      <p>The introduction section is very simple. It consists of three video elements and three audio elements.</p>
      <img src='timeline-1.png'/>
      <p>The first video element is the base video. This was just footage of the headphones with harsh lighting and shadows. I shot it by putting the headphones on a table in a dark room and moving my phone's flashlight around to get the desired lighting effect. In post, I added color grading and speed ramps and mixed all the clips together to get the base for the fast-paced intro sequence.</p>
      <p>The second video element is the movie countdown overlay. This is video I downloaded from online and set to the blending mode "Screen", then added opacity keyframes to make it pulse on each number.</p>
      <p>The third video element is the text - "sound quality", "comfort", and "build quality". These were all criteria of judgement for the headphoens that would come up later on the video. I dropped these into the intro and added opacity keyframes to make it look like it was being lit by the flashlight, and it added a nice effect.</p>
      <p>The base audio element was just the sound of wind howling. The "beep" tones from the countdown were added, and a static noise with volume envelopes reflecting the lighting was also added.</p>
      <p>At the end of the intro, the wind and static fade and a chord plays. The sound of a door opening and closing is heard in the background, then the music and A-roll start.</p>
      <p>Although each element was really simple, together they formed an intro that I thought formed an eye-catching and polished transition into the rest of the video.</p>
      <img src='screen-2.jpg'/>
      <p>For the A-roll shots, I stood in front of a blue wall in my living room. There was a big window on camera right, letting in a lot of light, and the white wall on camera left bounced a lot of it back, creating a pretty nice lighting setup. I filmed these shots with my RX10 II on a tripod in front of me and my laptop and Blue Yeti microphone on a piano bench in front of me to record audio.</p>
      <img src='screen-4.jpg'/>
      <p>On top of the A-roll, B-roll and titles were added. I shot all the B-roll either in my room or at Riverside Park with just my RX10 II and my tripod. On one of the days I stayed until the sun set, getting some really nice backlighting and color, as you can see in the thumbnail and the frame below.</p>
      <img src='screen-5.jpg'/>
      <p>Everything was put together in Adobe Premiere Pro. A few of the animated titles were made in After Effects. Since everything was shot in S-Log 2, I graded everything using Lumetri in Premiere Pro.</p>
      <p>Though the video was overall pretty simple, I'm really happy with how it turned out. I learned a lot about Premiere Pro and After Effects and applied some things I had learned earlier to use (character animation, color grading, volume/opacity animation, motion graphics), and had a lot of fun making this project.</p>
