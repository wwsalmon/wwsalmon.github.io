    <p>My name is Samson Zhang. I was born in Niskayuna, a town in upstate New York. My parents are from Henan, China. Today, I live with my mom and sister in New York City, and attend Columbia Secondary School in Harlem.</p>
    <p class='about-body-quote'>“Filmmaking is the art of telling stories through film.”</p>
    <p>I love filmmaking because it's such a powerful way to document events, to tell stories, and to spread messages.</p>
    <p>I love filmmaking because it's such an effective way to educate, to inform, to teach, to listen, and to learn.</p>
    <p>I love filmmaking because it brings me into contact with new people and their ideas and stories.</p>
    <p>I love filmmaking because it gives me a way to learn more about the things I love and share them with the world.</p>
    <p>I love filmmaking because it lets me be creative and challenge myself, to keep doing my best, to keep improving.</p>
    <p>I love filmmaking because through it I can learn, teach, document, commemorate, show, remind, collaborate, talk, listen, play, compete, and create, all at the same time.</p>
    <p class='about-body-quote'>“Do to learn, not learn to do.”</p>
    <p>^ my life philosophy.</p>
    <p>I taught myself filmmaking through experimentation and YouTube videos and articles on the web from Andyax, Film Riot, and NoFilmSchool.</p>
    <p>I learned how to edit videos by making Minecraft music videos in Windows Movie Maker and <strike>pirating</strike> using the free trials of programs like Camtasia Studio, Sony Vegas, and Adobe's CC suite.</p>
    <p>Through taking things I learn online and applying them to my own projects, I have learned a lot about concepts in filmmaking and how to use various powerful tools to accomplish what I want.</p>

      <p>I'm in fifth grade. I'm at my friend Ian's house with a bunch of other friends. In Ian's basement is a strobelight, just a light that flashed on and off really really quick. We set it up in a pitch-black basement room and everything felt like choppy stop motion. A friend says, "How cool would it be if we started a YouTube channel recording videos under the Strobelight?"</p>
      <p>I go early to Ian's house the next day. I bring my iPad. We find an apple crate in a side room and saw part of it off, creating a mount for my iPad. We strap the apple crate to the legs of an old telescope, creating a tripod to film with. That day, we film episode 1 of Strobelight Productions.</p>

      <p>I have always loved computers and technology. Two years ago, when my family got a new Dell XPS 13, I decided to make a review video for it. The video hit more than 20,000 views and kicked off my tech YouTube channel.</p>
      <p>My YouTube channel has been my way to experiment and improve my videography skills in the past few years. It gives my videos an audience that provides feedback and motivation to keep going. It also lets me learn more about things and products that I love and use every day and share it with the world.</p>
