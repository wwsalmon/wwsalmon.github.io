      <p>Originally assigned as a school project, the 24 minute short Fallen was the second narrative film I have made. With this film, I was able to explore more with story structure, lighting, special effects, and sound design, things that I hadn’t had many opportunities to explore before. The whole project was color graded, cut, and composited in Adobe Premiere Pro and After Effects CC, and shot in SLog-2 in 1080P on a Sony RX10 II with an f/2.8 24-200mm superzoom lens.</p>

      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <h4>Background</h4>
      <p>Narrative filmmaking has been something I’ve been passionate about for a while; however, the seemingly massive manpower required to pull off the creation of a short film stopped me from ever embarking on any major narrative film projects.</p>
      <p>Through making review videos on YouTube, I learned cinematography, lighting, editing, and color grading skills; by watching YouTube channels like DSLRGuide, D4Darious, Film Riot, Cinematography Database, and others, I learned about story structure and what was involved behind the scenes of actual short films.</p>
      <p>What I kept seeing was that there were tons of things that a director/producer of a short film needs to plan - scheduling, setup/breakdown, casting, post-production, and seemingly a million other things - and that all these things could and would go wrong on a film set, requiring extensive pre-production planning as well as relentless production and post-production improvisation and re-planning.</p>
      <p>I learned this for myself when I got the chance to make my first narrative short film when the final project for my biology class’s human body unit was to make a short film about diabetes. A basic plot with major plot points was given to us by my professor, and we had to make the rest.</p>
      <p>For that project, all production was crammed into the afternoons of two days and took maybe ten hours. Almost all of it was improv or the script for a scene was written from blank to final minutes before it was filmed; we filmed one scene after another based on location and actor convenience. I tried to use basic coverage techniques as much as possible, just trying not to break any rules and representing conversations as cohesively as possible; much of the camera work ended up being completely unplanned and made up on the spot, and lighting was all practical.

      <h3>Pre-Production</h3>
      <p>You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves like it has a mind. Like it knows it killed the world once and got a taste for murder. After the avalanche, it took us a week to climb out. Now, I don't know exactly when we turned on each other, but I know that seven of us survived the slide... and only five made it out. Now we took an oath, that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it was the snow that killed the other two, but it wasn't. Nature is lethal but it doesn't hold a candle to man.</p>
      <h4>Testing</h4>
      <p>Now that we know who you are, I know who I am. I'm not a mistake! It all makes sense! In a comic, you know how you can tell who the arch-villain's going to be? He's the exact opposite of the hero. And most times they're friends, like you and me! I should've known way back when... You know why, David? Because of the kids. They called me Mr Glass.</p>
      <p>Do you see any Teletubbies in here? Do you see a slender plastic tag clipped to my shirt with my name printed on it? Do you see a little Asian child with a blank expression on his face sitting outside on a mechanical helicopter that shakes when you put quarters in it? No? Well, that's what you see at a toy store. And you must think you're in a toy store, because you're here shopping for an infant named Jeb.</p>
      <p>Your bones don't break, mine do. That's clear. Your cells react to bacteria and viruses differently than mine. You don't get sick, I do. That's also clear. But for some reason, you and I react the exact same way to water. We swallow it too fast, we choke. We get some in our lungs, we drown. However unreal it may seem, we are connected, you and I. We're on the same curve, just on opposite ends.</p>
