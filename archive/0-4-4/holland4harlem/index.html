      <h1>Holland4Harlem (2017)</h1>

      <h2>Background</h2>

      <p>Marvin Holland is a U.S. Navy Veteran and former Transit Workers Union director that made a bid for NYC’s District 9 City Council seat in the 2017 election season. I joined the Holland4Harlem campaign as a social media intern helping with the YouTube page at first, then took on a graphic designer role, working closely with the campaign manager and social media team to create and refresh branding, posters, and animations. This case study showcases some of the work I did.</p>

      <h2>Let's Hear Harlem</h2>

      <p>“Let’s Hear Harlem is a podcast series where Democratic City Council Candidate Marvin Holland highlights issues facing Harlem by interviewing Harlem Residents and subject experts.”</p>

      <p>Based off of existing logos and videos, I redesigned the logo and brand for LHH and created thumbnails.</p>

      <h2>Main Branding</h2>

      <p>A previous designer had been hired to develop branding, but the resulting graphics were inconsistent and unpolished, including a file that I found called “quick-lhh-logo.jpg” (first image, upper right).</p>

      <p>I worked with the existing graphics and photography to develop a more polished and consistent set of graphics, mostly used in social media and posters.</p>

      <h2>Print Graphics</h2>

      <p>I worked closely with the campaign strategy team, as well as some third parties, to create poster-sized print designs highlighting key policy stances and campaign action messages.</p>

      <p>These were printed and hung up, as well as shared on social media.</p>

      <h2>Social Media Graphics</h2>

      <p>In addition to print posters, I also worked closely with the social media team to create graphics directly posted to social media accounts.</p>

      <p>These graphics were shared on Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook, leading to increased user interaction and exposure.</p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>

      <p>Marvin Holland’s bid for District 9 City Councilman effectively ended in the September 12th Democratic Primaries. He was the second-most popular candidate, winning 20% of Harlem, after incumbent Bill Perkins, who won 49%. Perkins went on to win the general elections with 78% of voters.</p>

      <p>Nevertheless, it was a great experience working with Marvin and his campaign team. For the first time, I was able to apply my graphic design skills to a real client, with real use cases, deadlines, and applications. I learned to communicate clearly, adapt rapidly and flexibly, and take initiative in situations like rebrandings. Through it all, I was also able to get involved in my community, learn about what the people around me have to say, and reach out to them on behalf of a a local grassroots politician.</p>
