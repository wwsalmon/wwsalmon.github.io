      <h1>A (mostly) complete history of wwsalmon.com</h1>

      <h2>0.1 - Exploration</h2>

      <p>These are my very first websites. I really had no idea what I was doing; none of these websites were functional in any way. Still, I learned a lot about HTML, CSS, and how hosting and domains on the web work. This was the period of exploration of just what was possible.</p>

      <h3>DaKoder Weebly Website</h3>
      <p>The very first iteration of my website. In Paint.NET, I built a mockup of a website; I bought a domain, a Weebly plan, and commissioned DeviantArt user DaKoder to turn my mockup into CSS code for something like $10. This code formed a Weebly theme, on top of which I threw in a bunch of my own content.</p>

      <p>I kept wanting small changes to the theme code, but eventually didn't want to keep bothering DaKoder again and again, so I just started tweaking it myself and trying to make it work. Inevitably I broke it and had to get DaKoder to fix it, but pretty quickly I got a basic understanding of HTML and CSS.</p>

      <h3>Blogger Template Website</h3>
      <p>Eventually I decided Weebly was too weird and expensive. Alternatively, Blogger was completely free, and seemingly had all the functionality I needed. I cancelled my Weebly plan and installed and customized a template on Blogger. These templates are completely code, copy + pasted into the Blogger CSS editor, but they were far too complicated for me to understand at the time. Thus my customizations were essentially a skin that sat on top of and overrode certain parts of the theme.</p>

      <h3>Blogger Ah, a Visitor Custom Website</h3>
      <p>Eventually, I learned how to make Blogger templates and just made my own template. It was tragically terribly designed.</p>

      <h2>0.2 - Experimentation</h2>

      <p>By this point I had a good grasp on HTML, CSS, and Blogger's proprietary markup. I still didn't really know what I wanted my website to be, just that I wanted one. Thus, this was the period of experimentation.</p>

      <h3>Blogger Masonry Website</h3>
      <p>Made a few mockups, but this time built them from code myself. This was a relatively polished and complete container for whatever posts I wanted to publish through Blogger. I published a few case studies and essays through this version of the site, and it worked well.</p>

      <h3>Splash Screen Experiments</h3>
      <p>Eventually I learned the trendy ways to design for the web - splash screens, bold imagery, branding, and lettering. I basically threw away the blog part and just used my website to experiment with different facades.</p>

      <h2>0.3 - Development</h2>

      <p>Note to self: rewrite this section to talk about creativity and all that</p>

      <p>By now I wasn't relying on any template system, just coding everything from scratch to be whatever I wanted it to be, and also skipping the mockups and just going straight from visual in my head to code. I was finding a style and actually producing things I was happy with, including several sites for specific purposes. This was the period of development.</p>

      <h3>0.3.1 - Blogger Minimal Custom Website</h3>
      <p>Inspired by Andrew Kim's minimallyminimal blog, this design was really focused on the blog posts, with a simple, stylish, and functional topbar and footer as the only flares. It was a really pretty design.</p>

      <h3>0.3.3 (skipped one) - Specialized Portfolios</h3>
      <h4>0.3.HW - helloworld.wwsalmon.com</h4>
      <p>Portfolio made for my application to PA Andover. Still one of my favorite designs to date. Great use of mono fonts, hierarchy to presentation of projects, colorful and rich case studys and footer. No topbar, no about page, no frills, just homepage with a list of projects and each project page. The last website I made in Blogger, but basically didn't use Blogger's features, just used template to override all Blogger systems and add from-scratch code for each page.</p>

      <h4>0.3.VD - wwsalmon.com/videoportfolio</h4>
      <p>Portfolio made for placement into a video class once I got into PA Andover. Again, segmented scrolling homepage: splash screen, about screen, list of projects. Frill with the projects - hovering over the image would make it slide up to reveal a sub image, or a GIF. Built my own custom JS image slider! My most technically difficult website made to date. This was my first major project hosted on Github Pages, which was also free but worked way better for just plugging in raw HTML and CSS code and making it work.</p>

      <h3>0.3.2 - Project Websites</h3>

      <p>Also built a bunch of little project websites on Github pages, namely: Russian Tanks project for my compsci class; Ebola project for my bio class. These were hosted at wwsalmon.github.io, and I overwrote everything each time.</p>

      <h2>0.4 - Refining</h2>
      <p>By now, I knew how to make a good website, built completely from scratch, and I knew how to make GitHub host it. I was still learning new tricks with flexbox and JQuery and the like, but I was fully capable of designing and coding the website I wanted. It was just a matter of narrowing my ideas down until I got what I wanted.</p>

      <h3>0.4.1 Sidebar Design</h3>
      <p>

      <h3>0.4.2 Hero Text + Staggered Squares</h3>
      <h3>0.4.3 Hero Paragraph + Staggered Squares</h3>
      <h3>0.4.4 Webtest, complete cleaned up rebuild of 0.4.3</h3>

      <h3>0.4.5 videoportfolio2</h3>
      <p>Summer 2018 - I had just made myself a filmmaking reel, and decided to redesign my website around it. Thus, it was to be a video portfolio, and was named videoportfolio2. This design took the hero paragraph idea from 0.4.3/0.4.4, but ditched the staggered squares; it also brought back the sidebar from 0.4.1, this time influenced by Alex Emerson (awemerson.com), and made the case studies even simpler and more contained. It's really really simple, with the only flairs being some little shadow and movement animations on hover.</p>

      <p>I decided I was happy with this iteration, and migrated everything to wwsalmon.github.io and made it live - archiving everything else.</p>
