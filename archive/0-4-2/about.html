          <p>My name is Samson Zhang. I live in New York City and attend Phillips Academy in Massachusetts. I work with graphics, web development, filmmaking, and video. I've worked with a political campaign, Columbia University's robotics team, and various school organizations and clubs. I'm constantly seeking new opportunities to learn and get real-world experience. Please don't hesistate to <a class='link' onclick='changePage("contact.html")'>contact me</a> or take a look at <a href='something.pdf'>my resume.</a></p>
          <p>Outside of code and pixels, I love playing piano and Rocket League, the former which I practice too little and the latter too much. I have been a part of two FIRST Robotics Competition teams, Columbia University's 2 Train Robotics (395) and Phillips Academy's Andover Snowflakes (????). One of my most treasured belongings is a collection of Isaac Asimov's robot short stories (The Complete Robot), and I mostly listen to Owl City and Logic.</p>
