        <p>Marvin Holland is a U.S. Navy Veteran and former Transit Workers Union director that made a bid for NYC’s District 9 City Council seat in the 2017 election season. I joined the Holland4Harlem campaign as a social media intern helping with the YouTube page at first, then took on a graphic designer role, working closely with the campaign manager and social media team to create and refresh branding, posters, and animations. This case study showcases some of the work I did.</p>

        <p>The team worked extremely hard through the months-long campaign, but in the end Marvin Holland lost the September 12th democratic primaries to incumbent Bill Perkins, finishing as the second most popular candidate ahead of Cordell Cleare, Tyson-Lord Gray, Marvin Spruill, and Julius Tajiddin. Still, working alongside such a dedicated and hardworking team and seeing effort translate into results in votes was an extremely rewarding and valuable experience and I’m extremely grateful to the H4H team for giving me this opportunity.</p>
