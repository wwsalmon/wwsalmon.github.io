          <p>Andover's cycling team has a relatively long history, but in its long history it's always been run out of a faculty member's garage. As a result, it's not very well known, even among students and faculty. With the newly built Snyder athletic center, we were finally able to get our own team room and gain some visibility. On top of this, we had two photographers on our team: Jacob Buehler, the Phillipian's sports editor, focused on capturing the action of the races; I focused on the moments when we weren't screaming down the road.</p>
